{"title":"\"Python Matrices\"","tutorial":"\"<p>\\n    <strong>In python, a matrix is defined simply as a list of lists.<\/strong>\\n    To make a matrix in python, you have to be familiar with lists. \\n    This was covered in the previous sections of this course. If you don't\\n    remember\/ or want to reapeat this exercise, you can navigate back to it by\\n    using the menu you find at the top of this page.\\n<\/p>\\n<p>\\n    To recap; this is how we created a list in python:\\n<\/p><br>\\n\\n\\n<pre><code># Creating a list in python\\nlist1 = [3, 8, 9, 1]\\n<\/code><\/pre><br>\\n\\n<p>\\n    This list represents one line in a simple 3 column matrix. Now, you might\\n    already understand how we would go about creating the rows. If you guessed \\n    a list of list, you'd be correct. <strong>This is how we define a list of \\n    lists in python:<\/strong>\\n<\/p><br>\\n\\n<pre><code># Creating a list of lists in Python\\nlist1 = [3, 8, 9, 1]\\nlist2 = [8, 3, 6, 0]\\nlist3 = [0, 8, 3, 1]\\n\\nmatrix = [list1, list2, list3]\\n<\/code><\/pre><br>\\n\\n\\n<p>\\n    And that's all that there is to it! This is how we create a simple matrix \\n    in python.
